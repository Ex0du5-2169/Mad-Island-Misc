"# Mad-Island-Misc" 
Mod planning:

Ultimately will become a full pregnancy handler for the game.

Short term plans:

1. Add ability for Yona to become pregnant by various monsters.
2. Add belly_preg object for Yona (and others who need one).
3. Add birthing animation/placeholder for those who don't have one.
4. Track impregnating monster and make offspring of a similar type by overriding default birth coroutine.

"# Mad-Island-Misc" 
Mod planning:

Ultimately will become a full pregnancy handler for the game.

Short term plans:

1. Add ability for Yona to become pregnant by several monsters.
2. Add "body_preg" object for Yona (and others who need one) - done - needs testing.
3. Add birthing animation/placeholder for those who don't have one - done - needs testing.
4. Track impregnating monster and make offspring of a similar type by overriding default birth coroutine.


Change log:

14/10/2024 00:06 - Added a list of animations used for birthing and some potential replacements for Yona, need to find others for Nami, Reika et al.
                 - Annotated some of my code. It's a mess but at least you can see my intentions with the commented lines.
                 
17/10/2024 12:31 - Changed mod name and guid.
                 - Added some test code for animation substitution.
